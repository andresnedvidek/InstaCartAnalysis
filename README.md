## Project Description: Instacart Sales Analysis

# Objective
I am tasked with analyzing sales data for Instacart, an online grocery store, to uncover insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation. This will help improve targeted marketing efforts.

# Context
Instacart stakeholders want to understand their customer base and purchasing behaviors to enhance marketing strategies. They aim to target different customer segments with tailored marketing campaigns to boost sales. My analysis will help inform this strategy by identifying key patterns and behaviors.

# Key Questions
Busiest Days and Times: Identify the days and times with the most orders to optimize ad scheduling.
Spending Patterns: Determine times of day when customers spend the most money to inform product advertising strategies.
Price Range Groupings: Simplify product pricing categories for better marketing direction.
Popular Products: Identify which product departments have the highest order frequencies.
Additionally, the marketing and sales teams want insights into different customer types and their ordering behaviors:

# Distribution and brand loyalty
Differences in ordering habits based on loyalty status and region
Connections between age, family status, and ordering habits
Demographic classifications (age, income, family status) and their impact on ordering behaviors

# Stakeholders
Vice President of Marketing: Seeking to improve ad campaign targeting.
Senior Vice President of Sales: Interested in identifying and improving areas with low market share.
Instacart Customers: Desire relevant ads, promotions, and product recommendations.

# Data
I will use open-source data sets from Instacart, along with a fabricated customer data set for this project. These data sets contain common identifiers to facilitate comprehensive analysis.
